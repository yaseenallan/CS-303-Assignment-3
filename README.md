HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

This program defines a generic queue using a linked list through a template class, allowing it to handle any data type. The queue supports common operations such as pushing elements to the rear, popping from the front, checking the front element, getting the size, and checking if itâ€™s empty. It also includes a custom function called move_to_rear which moves the front element to the back of the queue. In addition to the queue, the program implements a recursive function to find the last occurrence of a target value in a vector, scanning the list from the end. It also includes an insertion sort function that sorts a list of integers in ascending order. The main function demonstrates all features by creating a queue of integers, displaying its contents, using the move_to_rear function, finding a value's last occurrence in a vector, and sorting a list of numbers.
